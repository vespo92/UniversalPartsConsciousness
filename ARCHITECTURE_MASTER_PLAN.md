# Universal Parts Consciousness - Master Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary
Global-scale technical specification database capturing every mechanical part's complete dimensional data, compatibility matrices, and real-world variations. Zero ambiguity, total precision.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
```
[CAD Files] → [Parser] → [Dimension Extractor] → [Validation] → [Core DB]
[Standards] → [Spec Parser] → [Normalization] → [Validation] → [Core DB]  
[Field Data] → [OCR/Measure] → [Verification] → [Variation DB] → [Core DB]
[IoT Sensors] → [Stream Processor] → [Anomaly Detection] → [Usage DB]
```

### 2. Core Database Structure
```sql
-- Primary Tables (50M+ parts expected)
parts_specifications (partitioned by category/year)
thread_specifications (indexed by diameter/pitch)
material_properties (cached in Redis)
compatibility_matrix (graph database overlay)
field_variations (time-series partitioned)

-- Performance: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB + Neo4j + Redis
-- Sharding: By manufacturer/category
-- Replication: Multi-region with edge caching
```

### 3. Compatibility Engine Architecture
```python
class CompatibilityService:
    """Microservice handling 100k+ compatibility checks/second"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = RedisCluster()  # Hot paths
        self.compute = RayCluster()  # Distributed calculation
        self.db_pool = PostgresPool(size=1000)
    
    async def check_compatibility(self, part_a: str, part_b: str) -> Result:
        # L1 Cache: Redis (sub-ms)
        if cached := await self.cache.get(f"{part_a}:{part_b}"):
            return cached
            
        # L2 Compute: Distributed calculation
        result = await self.compute.remote(calculate_compatibility, part_a, part_b)
        
        # Cache warmup
        await self.cache.set(f"{part_a}:{part_b}", result, ttl=3600)
        return result
```

### 4. Global Distribution Network
```yaml
regions:
  us-east:
    primary: true
    database: master
    compute: 50_nodes
    
  eu-west:
    replica: true
    database: read_replica
    compute: 30_nodes
    edge_cache: Frankfurt, London, Paris
    
  asia-pacific:
    replica: true
    database: read_replica
    compute: 40_nodes
    edge_cache: Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney

sync_strategy:
  - Master writes to us-east
  - Async replication < 100ms
  - Eventual consistency for variations
  - Strong consistency for specifications
```

### 5. Data Sources & Integration

#### Manufacturing Integration
```python
# Direct CAD system integration
solidworks_connector = ManufacturerAPI("solidworks")
fusion360_connector = ManufacturerAPI("fusion360")
freecad_connector = OpenSourceAPI("freecad")

# Automated ingestion from:
# - McMaster-Carr catalog updates
# - Manufacturer specification releases
# - Standards body publications (ISO/DIN/ANSI)
```

#### Field Data Collection
```python
# Mobile app for technicians
class FieldMeasurementApp:
    def capture_part():
        photo = camera.capture()
        measurements = ar_measure(photo)  # AR measurement
        thread_gauge = bluetooth.read_gauge()
        
        return {
            "measured_dims": measurements,
            "thread_verified": thread_gauge,
            "context": gps_location + equipment_model,
            "confidence": calculate_measurement_confidence()
        }
```

### 6. API Architecture

#### GraphQL for Complex Queries
```graphql
query FindCompatibleParts {
  compatibility(
    need: {
      thread: "M5x0.8"
      minLength: 16
      maxLength: 20
      minStrength: 500  # N
    }
    have: {
      tools: ["4mm_hex_key", "torque_wrench_20nm"]
      materials: ["aluminum_6061"]
    }
  ) {
    parts {
      id
      specifications
      stockLocations
      compatibilityScore
      warnings
    }
  }
}
```

#### REST for Simple Lookups
```
GET /api/v1/part/{id}
GET /api/v1/thread/{spec}
GET /api/v1/compatible?thread=M5x0.8&length=16-20
POST /api/v1/validate-fit
```

### 7. Scaling Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (0-1M parts)
- Single region deployment
- PostgreSQL with standard indexing
- Basic caching layer
- Manual data ingestion

#### Phase 2: Growth (1M-50M parts)
- Multi-region read replicas
- Elasticsearch for part search
- ML-based dimension extraction from CAD
- Automated manufacturer feeds

#### Phase 3: Global Scale (50M+ parts)
- Full edge computing network
- Graph database for relationships
- Real-time IoT integration
- Predictive compatibility AI

### 8. Quality Assurance

#### Automated Validation
```python
class DimensionValidator:
    def validate_part(self, part: PartSpec) -> ValidationResult:
        checks = [
            self.check_dimension_sanity(),  # D > d1 > d2
            self.check_thread_standards(),   # Pitch matches diameter
            self.check_material_properties(), # Strength realistic
            self.cross_reference_sources(),   # Multiple sources agree
        ]
        return ValidationResult(checks, confidence_score)
```

#### Crowd Verification
- Technicians verify specifications in field
- Reputation system for contributors
- Consensus required for spec changes
- Blockchain for critical specifications
